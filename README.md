# Letter-Vomit-Typing-Game
A typing game that generates words with random letters instead of using a dictionary.

Most of the time I play typing games, I've realized that, once 
I process a word I need to type, I memorize it and type it from my memory instead of
continually looking at the word to type. As a result, I find that I perform really 
poorly on words that I don't know how to spell, since it takes more work to
coordinate what I am seeing with what I am typing.

I created Letter Vomit to help train this ability. After enough practice, you'll
be a master at speed typing words you don't know how to spell (and at typing in general). 
Then, you can beat all your friends in typing games.


PLAN TO:
- Add words per minute and characters per limit tracker
- Fix formatting when you're typing at the start of a line
- Make starting/restarting the game more interactive
- Host on website (for now, you'll need to download all the files and open the index.html file to play)

Thanks for reading!
